# Scrapbook Boilerplate
An HTML5 Boilerplate with a minimalist scrapbook aesthetic

## What is this?
This is a boilerplate setup for a basic HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript webpage.
The boilerplate is based on the design I used for [my website](http://xjcoan.com).

Converting the base html file to an embedded-language file (ERB, EJS, etc) should not pose a problem.

## What's included?
This file contains 3 main files that are integral to the boilerplate:

* `index.html` - The main html file
* `scrapbook.css` - Styling (contains the !important flag to overwrite bootstrap)
* `menu.js` - The hamburger menu interaction file

In addition, this boilerplate is set up for [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/),
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/), and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).

If you want/need additional font icons, like those included the [skills page of my site](http://xjcoan.com/skills.html), I'd recommend you'd check out [Font Mfizz](http://fizzed.com/oss/font-mfizz).

Note: I have no affiliation with Bootstrap, jQuery, Font Awesome, or Font Mfizz.  I simply admire their work üëç.

## Can I use this?
Absolutely.  There's an MIT-license, so have at it!
