# Scrapbook Boilerplate
An HTML5 Boilerplate with a minimalist scrapbook aesthetic

## What is this?
This is a boilerplate setup for a basic HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript webpage.
The boilerplate is based on the design I previously used for [my website](http://xjcoan.com).
(A preview of this design can be found [here](http://xjcoan.com/scrapbook-html-boilerplate))

Converting the base html file to an embedded-language file (ERB, EJS, etc) should not pose a problem.

## What's included?
This file contains 3 main files that are integral to the boilerplate:

* `index.html` - The main html file
* `scrapbook.css` - Styling (contains the !important flag to overwrite bootstrap)
* `menu.js` - The hamburger menu interaction file

### Versioning Info
As of April 3rd, 2018, this project uses JQuery 3.2.1, Bootstrap 4.0, Font Awesome 5.0.9
and all related dependencies.
